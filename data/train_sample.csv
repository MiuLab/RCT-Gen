"Emotional eating is associated with overeating and the development of obesity . Yet , empirical evidence for individual ( trait ) differences in emotional eating and cognitive mechanisms that contribute to eating during sad mood remain equivocal .The aim of this study was to test if attention bias for food moderates the effect of self-reported emotional eating during sad mood ( vs neutral mood ) on actual food intake . It was expected that emotional eating is predictive of elevated attention for food and higher food intake after an experimentally induced sad mood and that attentional maintenance on food predicts food intake during a sad versus a neutral mood .Hierarchical multivariate regression modeling showed that self-reported emotional eating did not account for changes in attention allocation for food or food intake in either condition . Yet , attention maintenance on food cues was significantly related to increased intake specifically in the neutral condition , but not in the sad mood condition .","The current findings show that self-reported emotional eating ( based on the DEBQ ) might not validly predict who overeats when sad , at least not in a laboratory setting with healthy women . Results further suggest that attention maintenance on food relates to eating motivation when in a neutral affective state , and might therefore be a cognitive mechanism contributing to increased food intake in general , but maybe not during sad mood ."
"Although working smoke alarms halve deaths in residential fires , many households do not keep alarms operational . We tested whether theory-based education increases alarm operability . http://www.clinicaltrials.gov number NCT00139126 .Homes in the Full Education and Practice arms were more likely to have a functioning smoke alarm at follow-up ( OR = 2.77 , 95 % CI 1.09 to 7.03 ) and had an average of 0.32 more working alarms per home ( 95 % CI 0.09 to 0.56 ) . Working alarms per home rose 16 % . Full Education and Practice had similar effectiveness ( p = 0.97 on both outcome measures ) .","Without exceeding typical fire department installation time , installers can achieve greater smoke alarm operability . Hands-on practice is key . Two years after installation , for every three homes that received hands-on practice , one had an additional working alarm ."
"This study was sponsored by a grant from the pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Urgo . S. Bohbot and O. Tacca are employees of Laboratoires Urgo . S. Meaume , J. Dissemond and G. Perceau have received monetary compensation as presenters for Laboratoires Urgo . Data management and statistical analyses were conducted independently by Vertical ( Paris , France ) .To evaluate the performance ( efficacy , safety and acceptability ) of a new micro-adherent absorbent dressing ( UrgoClean ) compared with a hydrofiber dressing ( Aquacel ) in the local management of venous leg ulcers , in the debridement stage .Altogether , 159 patients were randomised to either UrgoClean ( test group ; n = 83 ) or Aquacel ( control group ; n = 76 ) dressings . Regarding the wound healing process predictive factors ( wound area , duration , ABPI value , recurrence ) , at baseline , the two groups were well balanced , for both wound and patient characteristics . Compression therapy was administered to both groups and after a median 42-day treatment period , the percentage of relative reduction of the wound surface area was very similar ( -36.9 % vs -35.4 % in the UrgoClean and control groups , respectively ) . When considering the secondary criteria at week 6 , the relative reduction of sloughy tissue was significantly higher in the UrgoClean group than in the control group ( -65.3 % vs -42,6 % ; p = 0.013 ) . The percentage of debrided wounds was also significantly higher in the test group ( 52.5 % vs 35.1 % ; p = 0.033 ) .","This ` EARTH ' RCT confirmed that the UrgoClean dressing has similar efficacy and safety compared to Aquacel . However , UrgoClean also showed better autolytic properties than the control group in the management of venous leg ulcers at the sloughy stage . The new UrgoClean dressing therefore represents a promising therapeutic option within the current range of autolytic dressings available ."
"Eye movements ( EM ) during recall of an aversive memory is a treatment element unique to Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ( EMDR ) . Experimental studies have shown that EM reduce memory vividness and/or emotionality shortly after the intervention . However , it is unclear whether the immediate effects of the intervention reflect actual changes in memory . The aim of this study was to test whether immediate reductions in memory vividness and emotionality persist at a 24h follow up and whether the magnitude of these effects is related to the duration of the intervention .In both duration groups , recall with EM , but not recall only , caused an immediate decrease in memory vividness . There were no immediate reductions in memory emotionality . Furthermore , only the ` eight periods ' group showed that recall with EM , but not recall only , caused a decrease in both memory emotionality and memory vividness from the pre-test to the follow-up .","Only self-report measures were used . The findings suggest that recall with EM causes 24-hchanges in memory vividness/emotionality , which may explain part of the EMDR treatment effect , and these effects are related to intervention duration ."
"Few studies have tested the impact of motivational interviewing ( MI ) delivered by primary care providers on pediatric obesity . This study tested the efficacy of MI delivered by providers and registered dietitians ( RDs ) to parents of overweight children aged 2 through 8 .At 2-year follow-up , the adjusted BMI percentile was 90.3 , 88.1 , and 87.1 for groups 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . The group 3 mean was significantly ( P = .02 ) lower than group 1 . Mean changes from baseline in BMI percentile were 1.8 , 3.8 , and 4.9 across groups 1 , 2 , and 3 .","MI delivered by providers and RDs ( group 3 ) resulted in statistically significant reductions in BMI percentile .

"Youths with a family history of alcohol and other drug use disorders ( FH + ) are at a greater risk of developing substance use disorders than their peers with no such family histories ( FH - ) , and this increased risk may be related to impaired maturation of forebrain circuitry . FH + individuals have shown altered forebrain activity at rest and while performing cognitive tasks . However , it is not fully understood how forebrain activity is altered in FH + individuals , and ultimately how these alterations may contribute to substance use disorder risk .FH + youths had significantly greater cerebral activations in both the Go and Go/NoGo blocks than FH - youths in regions including the posterior cingulate/precuneus , bilateral middle/superior temporal gyrus , and medial superior frontal gyrus with no significant group differences in the subtraction between Go Only and Go/NoGo blocks . Additionally , FH + youths had moderately slower reaction times on go trials in the Go Only blocks .",Our findings suggest that global activation increase in FH + youths are modulated by FH density and are not specific to the inhibitory components of the task . This pattern of increased activations in FH + youths may be at least partially due to impaired forebrain white matter development leading to greater activations/less efficient neural communication during task performance .
"Risk factors have been proposed for running injuries including ( a ) reduced muscular strength , ( b ) excessive joint movements and ( c ) excessive joint moments in the frontal and transverse planes . To date , many running injury prevention programs have focused on a `` top down '' approach to strengthen the hip musculature in the attempt to reduce movements and moments at the hip , knee , and/or ankle joints . However , running mechanics did not change when hip muscle strength increased . It could be speculated that emphasis should be placed on increasing the strength of the ankle joint for a `` ground up '' approach . Strengthening of the large and small muscles crossing the ankle joint is assumed to change the force distribution for these muscles and to increase the use of smaller muscles . This would be associated with a reduction of joint and insertion forces , which could have a beneficial effect on injury prevention . However , training of the ankle joint as an injury prevention strategy has not been studied . Ankle strengthening techniques include isolated strengthening or movement-related strengthening such as functional balance training . There is little knowledge about the efficacy of such training programs on strength alteration , gait or injury reduction .

"The classification of clinical severity of Ebstein anomaly still remains a challenge . The aim of this study was to focus on the interaction of the pathologically altered right heart with the anatomically-supposedly-normal left heart and to derive from cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) a simple imaging measure for the clinical severity of Ebstein anomaly .Twenty-five patients at a mean age of 2614 years with unrepaired Ebstein anomaly were examined in a prospective study . Disease severity was classified using CMR volumes and functional measurements in comparison with heart failure markers from clinical data , ECG , laboratory and cardiopulmonary exercise testing , and echocardiography . All examinations were completed within 24 hours . A total right/left-volume index was defined from end-diastolic volume measurements in CMR : total right/left-volume index = ( RA + aRV + fRV ) / ( LA+LV ) . Mean total right/left-volume index was 2.61.7 ( normal values : 1.10.1 ) . This new total right/left-volume index correlated with almost all clinically used biomarkers of heart failure : brain natriuretic peptide ( r = 0.691 ; P = 0.0003 ) , QRS ( r = 0.432 ; P = 0.039 ) , peak oxygen consumption/kg ( r = -0.479 ; P = 0.024 ) , ventilatory response to carbon dioxide production at anaerobic threshold ( r = 0.426 ; P = 0.048 ) , the severity of tricuspid regurgitation ( r = 0.692 ; P = 0.009 ) , tricuspid valve offset ( r = 0.583 ; P = 0.004 ) , and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( r = 0.554 ; P = 0.006 ) . Previously described severity indices ( [ RA + aRV ] / [ fRV + LA+LV ] ) and fRV/LV end-diastolic volume corresponded only to some parameters .","In patients with Ebstein anomaly , the easily acquired index of right-sided to left-sided heart volumes from CMR correlated well with established heart failure markers . Our data suggest that the total right/left-volume index should be used as a new and simplified CMR measure , allowing more accurate assessment of disease severity than previously described scoring systems ."

"An increased production of oxidizing species related to reactive oral diseases , such as chronic apical periodontitis , could have systemic implications such as an increase in cardiovascular morbidity . Based on this consideration , we conducted a prospective study to assess whether subjects affected by chronic periodontitis presented with higher values of oxidative stress than reference values before endodontic treatment , and whether endodontic treatment can reduce the oxidative imbalance and bring it back to normal in these subjects .It was found that , on recruitment , the patients with chronic apical periodontitis exhibited significantly higher levels of oxidative stress than control patients , as determined by the d-ROMs and BAP tests . Furthermore , the d-ROMs test values were shown to decrease and the BAP test values to increase over time in patients with chronic apical periodontitis following endodontic therapy . As the levels of oxidative stress in these patients tended to reduce and return to normal by 90 days following treatment .","This study has demonstrated a positive association between chronic apical periodontitis and oxidative stress . Subjects affected by chronic apical periodontitis are exposed to a condition of oxidative stress , which is extremely dangerous to general health .

Thus , mild hypercapnia in the 24 h following cardiac arrest may increase cerebral blood flow and attenuate such injury . We describe the Carbon Control and Cardiac Arrest ( CCC ) trial . Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612000690853 .","The trial commenced in December 2012 and , when completed , will provide clinical evidence as to whether targeting mild hypercapnia for 24 h following intensive care unit admission for cardiac arrest patients is feasible and safe and whether it results in decreased concentrations of neurological injury biomarkers compared with normocapnia . Trial results will also be used to determine whether a phase IIb study powered for survival at 90 days is feasible and justified ."
"For decades thiopental has been considered as the hypnotic drug of choice for intracranial surgery . However , total intravenous anesthesia performed with thiopental is associated with delayed recovery , whereas early post-operative neurological evaluation is critical . For this reason , target controlled infusion ( TCI ) of propofol is increasingly used for maintenance of anesthesia . However , a thiopental TCI has never been assessed for this purpose . We tested the hypothesis that a thiopental TCI provides an acceptable way to achieve early recovery compared to a propofol TCI during supratentorial surgery .Time to extubation was significantly ( P < 0.0001 ) shorter in group P ( median 149 minutes ; interquartile range 72-250 minutes ) than in group T ( median 453 minutes ; interquartile range 286-813 minutes ) . Similarly , the recovery parameters were significantly better in group P than in group T. There was no difference between groups in terms of patient characteristics and hemodynamic parameters .","Even with TCI and bispectral index monitoring , thiopental is associated with an inappropriate delayed recovery from supratentorial surgery compared to propofol TCI ."

"Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with considerable health risks . Although continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) can mitigate these risks , effectiveness can be reduced by inadequate adherence to treatment . We evaluated the clinical safety and effectiveness of upper-airway stimulation at 12 months for the treatment of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea .The study included 126 participants ; 83 % were men . The mean age was 54.5 years , and the mean body-mass index ( the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters ) was 28.4 . The median AHI score at 12 months decreased 68 % , from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour ( P < 0.001 ) ; the ODI score decreased 70 % , from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour ( P < 0.001 ) . Secondary outcome measures showed a reduction in the effects of sleep apnea and improved quality of life . In the randomized phase , the mean AHI score did not differ significantly from the 12-month score in the nonrandomized phase among the 23 participants in the therapy-maintenance group ( 8.9 and 7.2 events per hour , respectively ) ; the AHI score was significantly higher ( indicating more severe apnea ) among the 23 participants in the therapy-withdrawal group ( 25.8 vs. 7.6 events per hour , P < 0.001 ) . The ODI results followed a similar pattern . The rate of procedure-related serious adverse events was less than 2 % .","In this uncontrolled cohort study , upper-airway stimulation led to significant improvements in objective and subjective measurements of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea .

"To identify facilitators and barriers to clinical trial implementation in Aboriginal health services .A fundamental enabler was that participants considered the research to be governed and endorsed by the local health service . That the research was perceived to address a health priority for communities was also highly motivating for both providers and patients . Enlisting the support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff champions who were visible to the community as the main source of information about the trial was particularly important . The major implementation barrier for staff was balancing their service delivery roles with adherence to often highly demanding trial-related procedures . This was partially alleviated by the research team 's provision of onsite support and attempts to make trial processes more streamlined . Although more intensive support was highly desired , there were usually insufficient resources to provide this .","Despite strong community and health service support , major investments in time and resources are needed to ensure successful implementation and minimal disruption to already overstretched , routine services . Trial budgets will necessarily be inflated as a result . Funding agencies need to consider these additional resource demands when supporting trials of a similar nature ."
"To compare the effect of incomplete caries removal ( ICR ) and indirect pulp capping ( IPC ) with calcium hydroxide ( CH ) or an inert material ( wax ) on color , consistency and contamination of the remaining dentin of primary molars .No cases of yellow dentin were observed after 3 months with CH compared to 33.3 % of the wax cases ( P < 0.05 ) . A statistically significant difference over time was observed only for CH regarding consistency . CH stimulated a dentin hardening process in a statistically higher number of cases than wax ( 86.7 % vs. 33.3 % ; P = 0.008 ) . Contamination changed significantly over time in CH and wax without significant difference between groups . It was concluded that CH and wax arrested the carious process of the remaining carious dentin after indirect pulp capping , but CH showed superior dentin color and consistency after 3 months .",
"In literature there is a general consensus that the use of the mirror improves proprioception . During rehabilitation the mirror is an important instrument to improve stability . In some sports , such as dancing , mirrors are widely used during training . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of a mirror on balance in young dancers . Sixty-four young dancers ( ranging from 9-10 years ) were included in this study . Thirty-two attending lessons with a mirror ( mirror - group ) were compared to 32 young dancers that attended the same lessons without a mirror ( non-mirror group ) . Balance was evaluated by BESS ( Balance Error Scoring System ) , which consists of three stances ( double limb , single limb , and tandem ) on two surfaces ( firm and foam ) . The errors were assessed at each stance and summed to create the two subtotal scores ( firm and foam surface ) and the final total score ( BESS ) . The BESS was performed at recruitment ( T0 ) and after 6months of dance lessons ( T1 ) .The repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed that for the BESS total score there is a difference due to the time ( F = 3.86 ; p < 0.05 ) . No other differences due to the group or to the time of measurement were found ( p > 0.05 ) . The analysis of the multiple regression model showed the influence of the values at T0 for every BESS items and the dominance of limb for stability on an unstable surface standing on one or two legs .","These preliminary results suggest that the use of a mirror in a ballet classroom does not improve balance acquisition of the dancer . On the other hand , improvement found after 6months confirms that at the age of the dancers studied motor skills and balance can easily be trained and improved ."

"Coronary artery bypass grafting using the radial artery has , since the 1990s , gone through a revival . Observational studies have indicated better long-term patency when using radial arteries . Therefore , radial artery might be preferred especially in younger patients where long time patency is important . During the last 10years different endoscopic techniques to harvest the radial artery have evolved . Endoscopic radial artery harvest only requires a small incision near the wrist in contrast to open harvest , which requires an incision from the elbow to the wrist . However , it is unknown whether the endoscopic technique results in fewer complications or a graft patency comparable to open harvest . When the radial artery has been harvested , there are two ways to use the radial artery as a graft . One way is sewing it onto the aorta and another is sewing it onto the mammary artery . It is unknown which technique is the superior revascularisation technique . ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT01848886.Danish Ethics committee number : H-3-2012-116 .

"During lower limb lengthening , distraction-induced muscle pain and surrounding joint contractures are frustrating complications for which few effective treatments are available .We evaluated Botulinum Toxin Type A ( BtX-A ) injection in the calf muscles during human tibial distraction osteogenesis . We hypothesized that it may decrease calf pain and increase ROM of the surrounding joints by reducing muscle stiffness .There were no differences in calf pain , knee and ankle ROM , and maximal calf circumferences between the two legs at each time point .","Local injection of 200IU BtX-A at the human calf muscle does not appear to reduce calf pain or help enhance ROM of the knee and ankle during tibial lengthening . However , the small sample size provided sufficient power to detect only relatively large clinical effects ; future , larger trials will be needed to determine whether smaller differences are present ."
"To assess potential of preoperative therapy with local steroid and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs ( SAIDs and NSAIDs ) for prolonging the hypotensive effect of trabeculectomy .Postoperative needling was required in 50 % of the controls , 35 % of the NSAIDs and 30 % of the SAIDs patients as well as 20 % the combination-therapy patients . Needling revision had to be performed in 10 % of patients from the control group and 5 % of patients from the NSAIDs group . Patients from the steroid and combination-therapy groups had no need in needling procedure . Further hypotensive therapy was required in 50 % of the control group , 35 % of the NSAIDs group , 25 % of the SAIDs group and 20 % of the combination-therapy group . During the first postoperative year complete success of the treatment was achieved in 50 % of the controls , 65 % of the NSAIDs patients , 75 % of the SAIDs patients , and 80 % of those under combination therapy . Qualified success during the same period was achieved in 100 % of cases .","Preoperative local anti-inflammatory therapy helped to increase the one-year complete success rate after trabeculectomy as compared with the controls . The most significant hypotensive effect was noted in the combination-therapy group ( 80 % ) , less significant -- in the steroid and non-steroid monotherapy groups ( 75 % and 65 % correspondingly ) .

"Exercise-induced muscle damage has been identified as one of the main causes of the progressive decrease in running and muscular performance found during marathon races .To examine the efficacy of wearing compression stockings to prevent muscle damage and to maintain running performance during a marathon competition .Total race time was not different between the control group and the compression stockings group ( 210 23 and 214 22 minutes , respectively ; P = .58 ) . Between the control group and the compression stockings group , postrace reductions in leg muscle power ( -19.8 % 17.7 % versus -24.8 % 18.4 % , respectively ; P = .37 ) and jump height ( -25.3 % 14.1 % versus -32.5 % . 20.4 % , respectively ; P = .27 ) were similar . At the end of the race , there were no differences between the control group and the compression stockings group in serum myoglobin ( 568 347 ngmL ( -1 ) versus 573 270 ngmL ( -1 ) , respectively ; P = .97 ) and creatine kinase concentration ( 390 166 UL ( -1 ) versus 487 227 UL ( -1 ) , respectively ; P = .16 ) .",The use of compression stockings did not improve running pace and did not prevent exercise-induced muscle damage during the marathon . Wearing compression stockings during long-distance running events is an ineffective strategy to avoid the deleterious effects of muscle damage on running performance .
"The relationships of left ventricular ( LV ) longitudinal and circumferential systolic dysfunction with diastolic performance in hypertensive patients have never been compared .In 532 asymptomatic hypertensive patients , circumferential function was assessed with the use of midwall fractional shortening ( mFS ) and stress-corrected mFS ( SCmFS ) , whereas longitudinal function was assessed with the use of left atrioventricular plane displacement ( AVPD ) and systolic mitral annulus velocity ( s ' ) . Early diastolic annular velocity ( e ' ) and the E/e ' ratio were measured . Global longitudinal and circumferential strain were determined in a subset of 210 patients . e ' was linearly related to all systolic indexes ( AVPD : R = 0.40 ; s ' : R = 0.39 ; mFS : R = 0.16 ; SCmFS : R = 0.17 ; all P < .0001 ) , but the correlations were stronger with longitudinal indexes than with circumferential ones ( P < .0001 ) . E/e ' was nonlinearly related to AVPD ( R = -0.49 ; P < .0001 ) and s ' ( R = -0.34 ; P < .0001 ) and showed no relationship with mFS and SCmFS . Longitudinal indexes were superior to circumferential ones in predicting e ' < 8 cm/s , E/e ' < 8 , and E/e ' 13 . The effect of LV geometry on LV diastolic function was evident among patients with preserved systolic longitudinal function , but was blunted among patients with impaired longitudinal function . In multivariable analyses , only longitudinal indexes remained associated with e ' and E/e ' . Analyses using strains provided similar results .","In asymptomatic hypertensive subjects , LV diastolic performance is independently associated with longitudinal systolic dysfunction , but not with circumferential systolic dysfunction . Subtle longitudinal systolic impairment plays a role in mediating the effect of LV geometry on diastolic performance . These findings may support the need of critically revising the concept of isolated diastolic dysfunction in these patients ."

"Cardiac mortality and electrophysiological dysfunction both increase with age . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) provides indices of autonomic function and electrophysiology that are associated with cardiac risk . How habitual physical activity among older adults prospectively relates to HRV , including nonlinear indices of erratic sinus patterns , is not established . We hypothesized that increasing the levels of both total leisure-time activity and walking would be prospectively associated with more favorable time-domain , frequency-domain , and nonlinear HRV measures in older adults .We evaluated serial longitudinal measures of both physical activity and 24-hour Holter HRV over 5 years among 985 older US adults in the community-based Cardiovascular Health Study . After multivariable adjustment , greater total leisure-time activity , walking distance , and walking pace were each prospectively associated with specific , more favorable HRV indices , including higher 24-hour standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals ( Ptrend = 0.009 , 0.02 , 0.06 , respectively ) and ultralow-frequency power ( Ptrend = 0.02 , 0.008 , 0.16 , respectively ) . Greater walking pace was also associated with a higher short-term fractal scaling exponent ( Ptrend = 0.003 ) and lower Poincar ratio ( Ptrend = 0.02 ) , markers of less erratic sinus patterns .","Greater total leisure-time activity , and walking alone , as well , were prospectively associated with more favorable and specific indices of autonomic function in older adults , including several suggestive of more normal circadian fluctuations and less erratic sinoatrial firing . Our results suggest potential mechanisms that might contribute to lower cardiovascular mortality with habitual physical activity later in life ."

Patients with a proteomic test classification of poor had worse survival on erlotinib than on chemotherapy ( hazard ratio 172 [ 95 % CI 108-274 ] , p = 0022 ) . There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatments for patients with a proteomic test classification of good ( adjusted HR 106 [ 077-146 ] , p = 0714 ) . In the group of patients who received chemotherapy , the most common grade 3 or 4 toxic effect was neutropenia ( 19 [ 15 % ] vs one [ < 1 % ] in the erlotinib group ) , whereas skin toxicity ( one [ < 1 % ] vs 22 [ 16 % ] ) was the most frequent in the erlotinib group .",Our findings indicate that serum protein test status is predictive of differential benefit in overall survival for erlotinib versus chemotherapy in the second-line setting . Patients classified as likely to have a poor outcome have better outcomes on chemotherapy than on erlotinib .
"This study was to evaluate the effect of intraoperative continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RALRP ) in the steep Trendelenburg ( ST ) .Significant differences in IOP were detected between the two groups by a linear mixed model analysis ( p < 0.001 ) . The highest mean IOP was 19.95.0 mm Hg in Group D and 25.75.0 mm Hg in Group C ; both were measured 60 minutes after the patients had been placed in the ST position . No significant between-group differences in ocular perfusion pressure , mean blood pressure , or heart rate were observed between the two groups . No ocular or other complications were noted .",Intraoperative continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine may help alleviate IOP increase in patients undergoing RALRP in the ST position .
"Disruptive or challenging behavior problems pose a threat to children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities and their caregivers . Psychopharmacological treatment is mostly studied with new-generation antipsychotics and has been criticized for adverse side effects . This study examined the effect of the classic antipsychotic zuclopenthixol .Of all patients included into the study , 15 were not randomized because of insufficient therapeutic effect , adverse event , or noncompliance . Kaplan-Meier estimations showed less aggressive behavior problems for the continuing subgroup ( n = 9 ) than in the placebo group ( n = 15 ) . Individual doses stayed < 10mg/day .",Zuclopenthixol proved to be effective in reducing challenging behavior in boys even at low doses .
"The purpose of this multicenter , open label , randomized phase III study was to determine whether ixabepilone resulted in improved overall survival ( OS ) compared with commonly used single-agent chemotherapy ( doxorubicin or paclitaxel ) in women with locally advanced , recurrent , or metastatic endometrial cancer with at least one failed prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen .At the time of database lock , 496 patients were randomized to receive ixabepilone ( n = 248 ) or control ( n = 248 ) ; nine patients in the control arm were not treated . The interim analysis of futility for OS ( 219 events ) favored the control chemotherapy arm ( hazard ratio = 1.3 [ 95 % confidence interval : 1.0-1 .7 ] , stratified log rank test P = 0.0397 ) , indicating that the study would not meet its primary objective . The study was discontinued based on the interim OS results . The frequency of adverse events was comparable between the treatment arms .",The study did not meet its primary objective of improving OS in the ixabepilone arm compared to the control chemotherapy arm . A favorable risk/benefit ratio was not observed for ixabepilone versus control at the time of the interim analysis . The safety results were consistent with the known safety profiles of ixabepilone and control .

"Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) has recently been made a class I indication in the treatment of AAA . In comparison to the conventional open surgical treatment , endovascular AAA repair ( EVAR ) is associated with equivalent long-term morbidity and mortality rates . Vascular surgeons perform majority of EVAR . There are no reports for the long-term results of this intervention performed by interventional cardiologists . We present one of the first reports of periprocedural and long-term outcomes of EVAR performed by interventional cardiologists .During the study period EVAR was attempted in 170 patients , with 27 % being women . The mean age was 74 years ( range 52-93 ) . The endovascular graft placement was successful in 96 % ( 163/170 ) of patients . Procedure failures were more common in women ( 6 of 46 vs 1 of 124 , P = 0.003 ) . The 30-day mortality was 1.8 % ( 3 of 170 ) . In patients with successful EVAR the mean follow-up was 30 months and mean length of hospital stay was 3.53.2 days . Major periprocedural complications were noted in 9 % patients ( 15 of 167 ) . During follow-up , six patients ( 3.5 % ) required re-intervention and additional 16 patients died with no aneurysm related deaths .",EVAR primarily performed by interventional cardiologists demonstrates high periprocedural and long-term success rates .

"Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) is a severe illness with high rates of relapse . Exposure and Response Prevention for AN ( AN-EXRP ) is a new approach that specifically addresses maladaptive eating behavior by targeting eating-related fear and anxiety . The aim of this study was to evaluate AN-EXRP as an adjunctive strategy to improve eating behavior during weight restoration , at a pivotal moment when treatment goals shift toward relapse prevention .The average test meal caloric intake of participants who received AN-EXRP increased from 352263 kcal at baseline to 401215 kcal post-treatment , while that of participants who received CRT decreased from 501232 kcal at baseline to 424221 kcal post-treatment [ t ( 28 ) = 2.5 , p = .02 ] . Improvement in intake was significantly associated with improvement in eating-related anxiety ( Spearman 's = 0.40 , p = .03 ) .","These data demonstrate that AN-EXRP , compared to a credible comparison intervention , is associated with better caloric intake in a laboratory meal over time in AN . Additional studies are required to determine whether incorporation of these techniques into a longer treatment program leads to enduring and clinically significant change ."
"Aggressive behaviour in psychosis is not uncommon . Community provision for people with psychosis has left informal caregivers to take on a greater role in their care . However , few studies have explored links between patient-initiated violence in mental health caregiving relationships and caregiver functioning . Our study investigated caregiver reports of aggressive acts committed by their relative with psychosis and their links to caregiver appraisals of the caregiving relationship and caregiver outcomes .One-half of the caregiver sample ( 52.9 % ) reported an incident of patient-initiated violence during their interview ; 62.2 % of these involved violence toward themselves , and 24.3 % toward property . Reports of patient violence were associated with caregiver ratings of hostility expressed toward patients , lower self-esteem , and emotion-focused coping . People caring on their own were more likely to report incidents of patient violence . Younger patients , males , and inpatients were more frequently identified as having a history of this kind of violence .","Our findings suggested that caregiver reports of patient-initiated violence in psychosis are not uncommon . Mental health staff need to be aware of the risks of such violence for caregivers of people with psychosis , and consider appropriate procedures for minimizing it ."
"Positive-pressure ventilation during transport of intubated patients is generally delivered via a hand-pressurized device . Of these devices , self-inflating resuscitators ( SIR ) and flow-inflating resuscitators ( FIR ) constitute the two major types used . Selection of a particular device for transport , however , remains largely an institutional practice .To evaluate the hypothesis that transport ventilation goals of intubated pediatric patients are better achieved using an FIR compared to an SIR .Overall , participants were four times more likely to deliver target breaths and one-third less likely to deliver unacceptable breaths using the FIR compared to the SIR . When comparing device performance , a 44 % increase in the proportions of target breaths and a 40.4 % decrease in unacceptable breaths using the FIR were observed ( P < 0.0001 for both ) .",Hand ventilation during patient transport is superior using the FIR compared to the SIR to achieve target ventilatory goals and avoid unacceptable ventilatory cycles .
"To examine efficacy of hysteroscopic removal of polyps and myomas on health-related quality of life and symptom severity at 1-year postprocedure .A total of 118 lesions ( 76 polyps , 42 myomas ) were removed .

"Evidence from armed conflict settings points to high levels of intimate partner violence ( IPV ) against women . Current knowledge on how to prevent IPV is limited-especially within war-affected settings . To inform prevention programming on gender-based violence in settings affected by conflict , we evaluated the impact of adding a targeted men 's intervention to a community-based prevention programme in Cte d'Ivoire . clinicaltrials.gov NCT01803932 .At follow-up , reported levels of physical and/or sexual IPV in the intervention arm had decreased compared to the control arm ( ARR 0.52 , 95 % CI 0.18-1 .51 , not significant ) . Men participating in the intervention reported decreased intentions to use physical IPV ( ARR 0.83 , 95 % CI 0.66-1 .06 ) and improved attitudes toward sexual IPV ( ARR 1.21 , 95 % CI 0.77-1 .91 ) . Significant differences were found between men in the intervention and control arms ' reported ability to control their hostility and manage conflict ( ARR 1.3 , 95 % CI 1.06-1 .58 ) , and participation in gendered household tasks ( ARR 2.47 , 95 % CI 1.24-4 .90 ) .","This trial points to the value of adding interventions working with men alongside community activities to reduce levels of IPV in conflict-affected settings . The intervention significantly influenced men 's reported behaviours related to hostility and conflict management and gender equitable behaviours . The decreased mean level of IPV and the differences between intervention and control arms , while not statistically significant , suggest that IPV in conflict-affected areas can be reduced through concerted efforts to include men directly in violence prevention programming .

"In most cases the only knowledge an individual will receive with regards to their own body and its proper functioning is during their high school education . The aim of this study was to evaluate high school students ' knowledge about basic physiology .One-thousand-and eighty-three ( out of 1179 invited -- 91.86 % ) Polish high school students ( 63.25 % female ) filled in a 20-item questionnaire constructed by the authors regarding basic human physiology . The mean age of the group was 17.66 0.80 years . The mean score among the surveyed was 10.15 3.48 ( range 0-20 ) . Only 26.04 % of students achieved a grade of 60 % or more , and only one person obtained the highest possible score .

"Emotional eating in children has been related to the consumption of energy-dense foods and obesity , but the development of emotional eating in young children is poorly understood .We evaluated whether emotional eating can be induced in 5-7-y-old children in the laboratory and assessed whether parental use of overly controlling feeding practices at 3-5 y of age predicts a greater subsequent tendency for children to eat under conditions of mild stress at ages 5-7 y.Children at ages 5-7 y who were exposed to a mild emotional stressor consumed significantly more calories from snack foods in the absence of hunger than did children in a control group . Parents who reported the use of more food as a reward and restriction of food for health reasons with their children at ages 3-5 y were more likely to have children who ate more under conditions of negative emotion at ages 5-7 y.",Parents who overly control children 's food intake may unintentionally teach children to rely on palatable foods to cope with negative emotions . Additional research is needed to evaluate the implications of these findings for children 's food intake and weight outside of the laboratory setting .
