"IgE sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus and a positive sputum fungal culture result are common in patients with refractory asthma . It is not clear whether these patients would benefit from antifungal treatment .We sought to determine whether a 3-month course of voriconazole improved asthma-related outcomes in patients with asthma who are IgE sensitized to A fumigatus .Sixty-five patients were randomized . Fifty-nine patients started treatment ( 32 receiving voriconazole and 27 receiving placebo ) and were included in an intention-to-treat analysis . Fifty-six patients took the full 3 months of medication . Between the voriconazole and placebo groups , there were no significant differences in the number of severe exacerbations ( 1.16 vs 1.41 per patient per year , respectively ; mean difference , 0.25 ; 95 % CI , 0.19-0 .31 ) , quality of life ( change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score , 0.68 vs 0.88 ; mean difference between groups , 0.2 ; 95 % CI , -0.05 to -0.11 ) , or any of our secondary outcome measures .","We were unable to show a beneficial effect of 3 months of treatment with voriconazole in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who were IgE sensitized to A fumigatus on either the rate of severe exacerbations , quality of life , or other markers of asthma control ."
"Opioid antagonists ( e.g. , naltrexone ) and positive modulators of - aminobutyric-acidA ( GABAA ) receptors ( e.g. , alprazolam ) modestly attenuate the abuse-related effects of stimulants like amphetamine . The use of higher doses to achieve greater efficacy is precluded by side effects . Combining naltrexone and alprazolam might safely maximize efficacy while avoiding the untoward effects of the constituent compounds .The present pilot study tested the hypothesis that acute pretreatment with the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam would not produce clinically problematic physiological effects or negative subjective effects and would reduce the positive subjective effects of d-amphetamine to a greater extent than the constituent drugs alone .Oral d-amphetamine produced prototypical physiological and stimulant-like positive subjective effects ( e.g. , VAS ratings of Active/Alert/Energetic , Good Effect , and High ) . Pretreatment with naltrexone , alprazolam , and their combination did not produce clinically problematic acute physiological effects or negative subjective effects . Naltrexone and alprazolam each significantly attenuated some of the subjective effects of d-amphetamine . The combination attenuated a greater number of subjective effects than the constituent drugs alone .",The present results support the continued evaluation of an opioid receptor antagonist combined with a GABAA-positive modulator using more clinically relevant experimental conditions like examining the effect of chronic dosing with these drugs on methamphetamine self-administration .
"The sequencing of learning materials greatly influences the knowledge that learners construct . Recently , learning theorists have focused on the sequencing of instruction in relation to solving related problems . The general consensus suggests explicit instruction should be provided ; however , when to provide instruction remains unclear .We tested the impact of conceptual instruction preceding or following mathematics problem solving to determine when conceptual instruction should or should not be delayed . We also examined the learning processes supported to inform theories of learning more broadly .Providing conceptual instruction first resulted in greater procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge of equation structures than delaying instruction until after problem solving . Prior conceptual instruction enhanced problem solving by increasing the quality of explanations and attempted procedures .","Providing conceptual instruction prior to problem solving was the more effective sequencing of activities than the reverse . We compare these results with previous , contrasting findings to outline a potential framework for understanding when instruction should or should not be delayed ."
"Patient adherence to appointments is key to improving outcomes in health care . `` No-show '' appointments contribute to suboptimal resource use . Patient navigation and telephone reminders have been shown to improve cancer care and adherence , particularly in disadvantaged populations , but may not be cost-effective if not targeted at the appropriate patients .Over a 5-month period , of the 40,075 appointments scheduled , 4425 patient appointments were deemed to be at high risk of a `` no-show '' event . After the patient navigation intervention , the no-show rate in the intervention group was 10.2 % ( 167 of 1631 ) , compared with 17.5 % in the control group ( 280 of 1603 ) ( P < .001 ) . Reaching a patient or family member was associated with a significantly lower no-show rate ( 5.9 % and 3.0 % , respectively ; P < .001 and .006 , respectively ) compared with leaving a message ( 14.7 % : P = .117 ) or no contact ( no-show rate , 21.6 % : P = .857 ) .","Telephone navigation targeted at those patients predicted to be at high risk of visit nonadherence was found to effectively and substantially improve patient adherence to cancer clinic appointments . Further studies are needed to determine the long-term impact on patient outcomes , but short-term gains in the optimization of resources can be recognized immediately ."
"Insufficient skills in drug dose calculations increase the risk for medication errors . Even experienced nurses may struggle with such calculations . Learning flexibility and cost considerations make e-learning interesting as an alternative to classroom teaching . This study compared the learning outcome and risk of error after a course in drug dose calculations for nurses with the two methods .16 men and 167 women participated in the study , aged 42.0 ( 9.5 ) years with a working experience of 12.3 ( 9.5 ) years .

"To estimate age at attaining Tanner stages in Ugandan/Zimbabwean HIV-infected children initiating antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) in older childhood and investigate predictors of delayed puberty , particularly age at ART initiation .Median age at ART initiation was 9.4 years ( inter-quartile range 7.8 , 11.3 ) ( n = 582 ) . At the first assessment , the majority ( 80.2 % ) were in Tanner stage 1 ; median follow-up with staging was 2.8 years . There was a strong delaying effect of older age at ART initiation on age at attaining all Tanner stages ( P < 0.05 ) and menarche ( P = 0.02 ) ; in boys the delaying effect generally weakened with older age . There were additional significant delays associated with greater impairments in pre-ART height-for-age Z-score ( P < 0.05 ) in both sexes and pre-ART BMI-for-age in girls ( P < 0.05 ) . There was no evidence that pre-ART immuno-suppression independently delayed puberty or menarche . However , older children/adolescents had significant growth spurts in intermediate Tanner stages , and were still significantly increasing their height when in Tanner stage 5 ( P < 0.01 ) .","Delaying ART initiation until older childhood substantially delays pubertal development and menarche , independently of immuno-suppression . This highlights that factors other than CD4 , such as pubertal development , need consideration when making decisions about timing of ART initiation in older children ."
"Dutch trial register NTR1942 .To assess the effects of a patient oriented decision aid for prioritising treatment goals in diabetes compared with usual care on patient empowerment and treatment decisions .Of all intervention participants , 103 ( 46 % ) reported to have received the basic elements of the intervention . For the primary outcome analysis , 199 intervention and 107 control patients with sufficient baseline and follow-up data could be included . The mean empowerment score increased 0.1 on a 5 point scale in the overall intervention group , which was not significantly different from that of the control group ( mean difference after adjusting for baseline 0.039 , 95 % confidence interval -0.056 to 0.134 ) . Lipid regulating drug treatment was intensified in 25 % of intervention and 12 % of control participants with increased cholesterol levels , which did not reach significance when the intervention was compared with the usual care group ( odds ratio 2.54 , 95 % confidence interval 0.89 to 7.23 ) .

"Bicalutamide blocks androgen action and is frequently used in men with non-metastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . By reducing intracellular dihydrotestosterone , dutasteride ( dual 5-alpha reductase inhibitor ) could increase the effectiveness of bicalutamide in this setting . The objective of the study is therefore to prospectively evaluate dutasteride plus bicalutamide in men with asymptomatic , non-metastatic CRPC with rising prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) .There was no statistically significant difference in TDP in 127 men treated with bicalutamide/dutasteride ( n = 62 ) compared with bicalutamide/placebo ( n = 65 ) ( hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.94 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.61 , 1.46 ] ; p = 0.79 ) .

"Menopause is the stage when the menstrual period permanently stops , and is a part of every woman 's life . It usually occurs between the ages of 40 and 60 years , and is associated with hormonal , physical , and psychological changes . Estrogen and progesterone levels play the biggest part in menopause . In this stage , the ovaries make less estrogen and progesterone . When the body produces less of these hormones , the parts of the body that depend on estrogen to keep them healthy will react and this often causes discomfort for women . This study tested the impact of a complementary health approach to quality of life in menopausal women .There was an extremely high statistically significant difference ( P = 0.001 ) between the study group and the control group with regard to the physical , psychological , social , and environmental domains of quality of life after 6 , 12 , and 18 weeks of yoga therapy . The mean gain score was high in all the domains of quality of life in the study group at weeks 6 , 12 , and 18 . The overall mean gain score in the study group was 31.58 versus 1.61 in the control group . The overall mean gain score difference was 29.97 in all domains of quality of life between the study group and the control group .

"Tubal ectopic pregnancy can be surgically treated by salpingectomy , in which the affected Fallopian tube is removed , or salpingotomy , in which the tube is preserved . Despite potentially increased risks of persistent trophoblast and repeat ectopic pregnancy , salpingotomy is often preferred over salpingectomy because the preservation of both tubes is assumed to offer favourable fertility prospects , although little evidence exists to support this assumption . We aimed to assess whether salpingotomy would improve rates of ongoing pregnancy by natural conception compared with salpingectomy . Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development ( ZonMW ) , Region Vstra Gtaland Health & Medical Care Committee .446 women were randomly assigned between Sept 24 , 2004 , and Nov 29 , 2011 , with 215 allocated to salpingotomy and 231 to salpingectomy . Follow-up was discontinued on Feb 1 , 2013 . The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate was 607 % after salpingotomy and 562 % after salpingectomy ( fecundity rate ratio 106 , 95 % CI 081-138 ; log-rank p = 0678 ) . Persistent trophoblast occurred more frequently in the salpingotomy group than in the salpingectomy group ( 14 [ 7 % ] vs 1 [ < 1 % ] ; RR 150 , 20-1134 ) . Repeat ectopic pregnancy occurred in 18 women ( 8 % ) in the salpingotomy group and 12 ( 5 % ) women in the salpingectomy group ( RR 16 , 08-33 ) . The number of ongoing pregnancies after ovulation induction , intrauterine insemination , or IVF did not differ significantly between the groups . 43 ( 20 % ) women in the salpingotomy group were converted to salpingectomy during the initial surgery because of persistent tubal bleeding . Our meta-analysis , which included our own results and those of one other study , substantiated the results of the trial .","In women with a tubal pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube , salpingotomy does not significantly improve fertility prospects compared with salpingectomy ."
"To examine the diagnostic accuracy of novel biomarkers of myocardial injury and troponin assays for diagnosis of myocardial infarction .68 patients had a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction .

Addition of HFABP to high-sensitivity troponin increased diagnostic sensitivity . Additional measurement of copeptin is not useful in the chest pain population .
"Multidimensional tinnitus models describe dysfunctional cognitions as a complicating factor in the process of tinnitus habituation . However , this concept has rarely been investigated in previous research .The present study investigated the effects of two cognitive-behavioral treatments on dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions in patients with chronic tinnitus . Furthermore , dysfunctional cognitions were examined as possible predictors of the therapeutic effect on tinnitus distress .Multivariate ANOVAs with post hoc tests revealed significant and comparable reductions of dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions for both treatments ( GCBT and ICBT ) , which remained stable over a 6 - and 12-month period . Negative correlations were found between the catastrophic subscale of the T-Cog and therapy outcome for ICBT , but not for GCBT . This means a higher degree of catastrophic thinking at baseline was associated with lower benefit from ICBT directly after the treatment . Hierarchical regression analysis confirmed catastrophizing as a predictor of poorer therapy outcome regarding emotional tinnitus distress in ICBT . No associations were detected in the follow-up assessments .",Both forms of CBT are successful in reducing dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions . Catastrophizing significantly predicted a less favorable outcome regarding emotional tinnitus distress in ICBT . Clinical implications of these results are described .

"Handling emergency telephone consultations ( ETCs ) is a challenging and very important task for doctors . The aims of the study were to document insecurity in medical students during ETCs and to identify the reasons for that insecurity . We hypothesised that insecurity is associated with advising more urgent action ( e.g. advice to call for an ambulance ) in ETCs .Overall , 95 % of the students felt insecure in at least one phase of their ETC. . History taking was the phase in which students felt most insecure ( 63.1 % ) , followed by the phase of analysing the information given by the patient ( 44.9 % ) . Perceived insecurity was associated with more urgent advice in one case scenario ( abdominal pain ; correlation r = 0.46 ; p < 0.01 ) . The other two cases ( child with fever ; chest pain ) also had a positive , but not statistically significant , correlation trend ( p < 0.12 ; p < 0.08 ) .","Insecurity is highly prevalent among medical students in their ETC decision-making . ETC training in medical schools , with a focus on structured history taking and formulating discriminating questions , might help decrease insecurity in ETCs .

"To study the effects of oromucosal detomidine gel administered sublingually to calves prior to disbudding , and to compare its efficacy with intravenously ( IV ) administered detomidine .The maximum plasma detomidine concentration after GEL was 2.1 1.2 ng mL ( -1 ) ( mean SD ) and the time of maximum concentration was 66.0 36.9 minutes . The bioavailability of detomidine was approximately 34 % with GEL . Similar sedation scores were reached in both groups after administration of detomidine , but maximal sedation was reached earlier in the IV group ( 10 minutes ) than in the GEL group ( 40 minutes ) . HR was lower after IV than GEL from 5 to 10 minutes after administration . All animals were adequately sedated , and we were able to administer local anaesthetic without resistance to all of the calves before disbudding .",Oromucosally administered detomidine is an effective sedative agent for calves prior to disbudding .
"Several studies have demonstrated that local ischemic preconditioning can reduce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiac surgery patients ; however , preconditioning has not become a standard cardioprotective intervention , primarily because of the increased risk of atheroembolism during repetitive aortic cross-clamping . In the present study , we aimed to describe and validate a novel technique of preconditioning induction .Preconditioning resulted in a significant reduction in the TnI level on the 7th postoperative day only ( 0.100.05 and 0.330.88 ng/ml in Preconditioning and Perfusion groups , respectively , P < 0.05 ) . In addition , cardiac index was significantly higher in the Preconditioning group than in the Control and Perfusion groups just after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass . The number of patients requiring inotropic support with2 agents after surgery was significantly lower in the Preconditioning and Perfusion group than in the Control group ( P < 0.05 ) . No complications of the procedure were recorded in the Preconditioning group .","The preconditioning procedure described can be performed safely in cardiac surgery patients . The application of this technique of preconditioning was associated with certain benefits , including improved left ventricular function after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and a reduced need for inotropic support . However , the infarct-limiting effect of preconditioning in the early postoperative period was not evident . The procedure does not involve repetitive aortic cross-clamping , thus avoiding possible embolic complications ."
"Minimal-change nephrotic syndrome ( MCNS ) is a common cause of steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) with frequent relapse . Although steroids and calcineurin inhibitors ( CNIs ) are the cornerstone treatments , the use of rituximab ( RTX ) , a monoclonal antibody targeting B cells , is an efficient and safe alternative in childhood .Complete ( NS remission and withdrawal of all immunosuppressants ) and partial ( NS remission and withdrawal of at least one immunosuppressants ) clinical responses were obtained for 25 and 7 patients , respectively ( overall response 78 % ) , including 3 patients that only received RTX and had a complete clinical response . After a follow-up time of 39 months ( 6-71 ) , relapses occurred in 18 responder patients [ 56 % , median time 18 months ( 3-36 ) ] . Seventeen of these received a second course of RTX and then had a complete ( n = 13 ) or partial ( n = 4 ) clinical response . From multivariate analysis , on-going mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) therapy at the time of RTX was the only predictive factor for RTX failure [ HR = 0.07 95 % CI ( 0.01-0 .04 ) , P = 0.003 ] . Interestingly , nine patients were still in remission at 14 months ( 3-36 ) after B-cell recovery . No significant early or late adverse event occurred after RTX therapy .",RTX is safe and effective in adult patients with MCNS and could be an alternative to steroids or CNIs in patients with a long history of relapsing MCNS .
"Extracorporeal circulation ( ECC ) of blood during cardiopulmonary surgery has been shown to stimulate various proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines and chemokines . The biochemical oxidation/reduction pathways of - lipoic acid suggest that it may have antioxidant properties .Cytokine IL-6 and IL-8 levels were significantly higher after surgery . Compared with the control groups , LA significantly decreased IL-6 and IL-8 levels in a time-dependent manner . CRP levels did not show significant variation in the first three time periods . CRP levels were higher after surgery , especially in the later periods . These results demonstrate that CRP formation depends on cytokine release . C3 and C4 levels were significantly higher after surgery than in the pre-operative period . LA treatment decreased C3 and C4 levels . Therefore , LA administration may be useful for the treatment of diseases and processes where excessive cytokine release could cause oxidative damage .",Our findings suggest a possible benefit of using LA during cardiac surgery to reduce cytokine levels .

"Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) bronchiolitis in infancy is a major risk factor for recurrent wheezing and asthma . Because azithromycin attenuated neutrophilic airway inflammation in a murine viral bronchiolitis model , demonstration of similar effects in human subjects might provide a strategy for the prevention of postbronchiolitis recurrent wheezing .We sought to investigate whether azithromycin treatment during RSV bronchiolitis reduces serum and nasal lavage IL-8 levels and the occurrence of postbronchiolitis recurrent wheezing .Compared with placebo , azithromycin treatment did not reduce serum IL-8 levels at day 8 ( P = .6 ) but resulted in a greater decrease in nasal lavage fluid IL-8 levels by day 15 ( P = .03 ) . Twenty-two percent of azithromycin-treated participants experienced at least 3 wheezing episodes compared with 50 % of participants in the placebo group ( P = .07 ) . Azithromycin treatment resulted in prolonged time to the third wheezing episode ( P = .048 ) and in fewer days with respiratory symptoms over the subsequent year in comparison with placebo ( 36.7 vs 70.1 days , P = .01 ) .","In this proof-of-concept study azithromycin treatment during RSV bronchiolitis reduced upper airway IL-8 levels , prolonged the time to the third wheezing episode , and reduced overall respiratory morbidity over the subsequent year ."

"Considering the increasing incidence of chronic kidney disease and the increased use of peritoneal dialysis , we wanted to assess whether the multidisciplinary management of patients in peritoneal dialysis might produce improvement in the quality of patients ' lives when compared to management by a routine team of operators .In group B , the number of days of hospitalization and day hospital were more than 88 % lower when compared to group A. The multidisciplinary team achieved better results with the KDQOL-SF test with regards to both emotional and objective dimensions . The Pearson coefficient between the results of the two questionnaires shows how multidisciplinary management can positively influence the perceived well-being of the patient and his or her adherence to treatment .","In a multidisciplinary team , each operator , in addition to his or her specific role , also contributes to the achievement of the overall objective , namely of ensuring an optimal quality of life to the patient on peritoneal dialysis thereby allowing these patients to continue their professional and social lives ."
"clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT01789177 .Changes in pulmonary dynamics following laparotomy are well documented . Deep breathing exercises , with or without incentive spirometry , may help counteract postoperative decreased vital capacity ; however , the evidence for the role of incentive spirometry in the prevention of postoperative atelectasis is inconclusive . Furthermore , data are scarce regarding the prevention of postoperative atelectasis in sub-Saharan Africa . To determine the effect of the use of incentive spirometry on pulmonary function following exploratory laparotomy as measured by forced vital capacity ( FVC ) .A total of 150 patients were randomized ( 75 in each arm ) . The median age in the intervention and control groups was 35 years ( interquartile range , 28-53 years ) and 33 years ( interquartile range , 23-46 years ) , respectively . Men predominated in both groups , and most patients underwent emergency procedures ( 78.7 % in the intervention group and 84.0 % in the control group ) . Mean initial FVC did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups ( 0.92 and 0.90 L , respectively ; P = .82 [ 95 % CI , 0.52-2 .29 ] ) . Although patients in the intervention group tended to have higher final FVC measurements , the change between the first and last measured FVC was not statistically significant ( 0.29 and 0.25 L , respectively ; P = .68 [ 95 % CI , 0.65-1 .95 ] ) .

"Fluid therapy is widely used in critically ill patients to restore effective intravascular volume and improve organ perfusion . Recent studies have questioned the administration of colloid-based solutions , especially if containing hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) , in different ICU populations ; however , there is still uncertainty on the use of colloids as initial fluid therapy for early resuscitation .Among the 6498 eligible patients , 2857 were eventually randomized in one of the two groups . The 28-day mortality was 25.4 % in the colloid and 27.0 % in the crystalloid group ( P = 0.26 ) . In the sub-group analysis , similar mortality rates were reported for shock due to hypovolemia , sepsis or trauma . Also , the use of continuous renal replacement therapy was similar between groups ( 11.0 % vs. 12.5 % , P = 0.19 ) . There were more days alive without mechanical ventilation or vasopressors during the first 7 and 28 days and a lower 90-day mortality in the colloid group .",These data suggest that mortality was not increased and probably decreased with the use of colloids in different forms of shock requiring early fluid resuscitation . We discussed herein some methodological issues that may explain the discrepancies of this trial with the other studies developed in the same field .
Cochlear implantation with the aim of hearing preservation for combined electric-acoustic stimulation ( EAS ) is the therapy of choice for patients with residual low-frequency hearing . Preserved residual acoustic hearing has a positive effect on speech intelligibility in difficult noise conditions .The goal of this study was to assess speech reception thresholds in various complex noise conditions for patients with EAS in comparison with patients using bilateral cochlear implants ( CI ) .The average SRTs in the EAS group were significantly better in all test conditions than those of the group with bilateral CI . Both user groups showed significant improvement in the MSNF condition compared with the frontal noise condition as a result of bilateral interaction . The normal-hearing control group was able to use short temporal gaps in modulated noise to improve speech perception in noise ( gap listening ) . This effect was absent in both implanted user groups .,Patients with combined EAS in one ear and a hearing aid in the contralateral ear show significantly improved speech perception in complex noise conditions compared with bilateral CI recipients .

"Sarcopenia is currently best described as an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function . However , no consensus exists as to how to best quantify muscle function in older adults . The muscle quality index ( MQI ) was recently recommended as an ideal evidence-based assessment of functional status in older adults . Nevertheless , the usefulness of MQI to assess physical function is limited by whether it is reflective of muscle qualitative changes to an intervention . Thus , the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether MQI changes in response to resistance exercise training and detraining and how such changes correspond to other recommended measures of physical function proposed by suggested definitions of sarcopenia .Short term resistance training significantly and clinically improved MQI ( 203.464.31 to 244.382.92 W ) , gait time ( 1.850.36 to 1.660.27 s ) and sit to stand performance ( 13.212.51 to 11.051.58 s ) . Changes in LBM and hand grip strength were not significant or clinically meaningful . De-training for 6-weeks did not result in significant changes in any measure from post-training performance .",
"The decreased number and senescence of circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) are considered markers of vascular senescence associated with aging , atherosclerosis , and coronary artery disease ( CAD ) in elderly . In this study , we explore the role of vascular senescence in premature CAD ( PCAD ) in a developing country by comparing the numerical status and senescence of circulating EPCs in PCAD patients to controls .The number of EPCs ( 0.18 % Vs. 0.039 % of total WBCs , p < 0.0001 ) , and EPC-TL ( 3.83 Vs. 5.10 kb/genome , p = 0.009 ) were markedly lower in PCAD patients compared to controls . These differences persisted after adjustment for age , sex , BMI , smoking and medications . EPC-TA was reduced in PCAD patients , but was statistically significant only after adjustment for confounding factors ( 1.81 Vs. 2.20 IU/cell , unadjusted p = 0.057 , adjusted p = 0.044 ) .",We observed an association between increased vascular cell senescence with PCAD in a sample of young patients from India . This suggests that early accelerated vascular cell senescence may play an important mechanistic role in CAD epidemic in developing countries like India where PCAD burden is markedly higher compared to developed countries .

"Obesity is associated with cardiometabolic disease , including insulin resistance ( IR ) and diabetes . Cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) signaling affects energy balance , IR , and glucose metabolism in experimental models . We sought to examine effects of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with tadalafil on IR in a pilot study of obese nondiabetic individuals . ClinicalTrials.gov . Unique Identifier : NCT01444651 .We conducted a randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial of adults age 18 to 50 years with obesity and elevated fasting insulin levels ( 10 U/mL ) . Participants were randomized to tadalafil 20 mg daily or placebo for 3 months . Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed , and the effect of tadalafil on IR was examined . A total of 53 participants ( mean age , 33 years ; body mass index [ BMI ] , 38 kg/m ( 2 ) ) were analyzed , 25 randomized to tadalafil and 28 to placebo . In the overall sample , measures of IR did not differ between tadalafil and placebo groups at 3 months . However , in individuals with severe obesity ( BMI 36.2 kg/m ( 2 ) ) , tadalafil use was associated with improved IR ( homeostatic model assessment for IR ) , compared to placebo ( P = 0.02 , respectively ) . Furthermore , one measure of - cell compensation for IR ( oral disposition index ) improved with tadalafil in the overall sample ( P = 0.009 ) and in the subgroup with severe obesity ( P = 0.01 ) .","Results of this pilot study did not show improvements in IR with tadalafil , compared to placebo .

"Inpatient medical settings offer an opportunistic environment for initiating smoking cessation interventions to patients reflecting on their health . Current evidence has shown the superior efficacy of varenicline tartrate ( VT ) for smoking cessation compared with other tobacco cessation therapies ; however , recent evidence also has highlighted concerns about the safety and tolerability of VT. . Given these apprehensions , we aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of VT plus quitline-counseling compared to quitline-counseling alone in the inpatient medical setting .VT was well tolerated in the inpatient setting among subjects admitted with acute smoking-related illnesses ( mean age 52.82.89 and 53.72.77 years in the VT+C and counseling alone groups , respectively ) . The most common self-reported adverse event during the 12-week treatment phase was nausea ( 16.3 % in the VT+C group compared with 1.5 % in the counseling alone group ) . Thirteen deaths occurred during the study period ( n = 6 were in the VT+C arm compared with n = 7 in the counseling alone arm ) . All of these subjects had known comorbidities or developed underlying comorbidities .","VT appears to be a safe and well-tolerated opportunistic treatment for inpatient smokers who have related chronic disease .

"It has been well documented that the maturing oocyte is very vulnerable to changes in its micro-environment , the follicular fluid ( FF ) . Recent research has focused on different components within this FF , like hormones , growth factors and metabolites , and how their concentrations are altered by diet and the metabolic health of the mother . It has been proposed that fatty acids ( FAs ) are potential factors that influence oocyte maturation and subsequent embryo development . However , a thorough study of the specific FF FA composition per lipid fraction and how this may be affected by BMI is currently lacking . Therefore , we investigated the BMI-related concentration of FAs in the phospholipid ( PL ) , cholesteryl-ester ( CHE ) , triglyceride ( TG ) and non-esterified ( NE ) lipid fraction in the FF of women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment ( ART ) .Total FA concentrations in the PL and CHE fraction did not differ between BMI groups . Total TG concentrations tended to differ and total NEFA concentrations differed significantly between BMI groups . Interestingly , 42 % and 34 % of the total FAs was esterified in the PL and CHE fraction , respectively , while only 10 % were present in both the TG and NEFA fraction . Only few individual FA concentrations differed in the PL , CHE and TG fraction between BMI groups , whereas abundant BMI-related differences were found in the NEFA fraction .","Our data show that differences in BMI are associated with alterations in the FA composition of the FF , an effect most pronounced in the NEFA fraction . These BMI-related variations could possibly affect granulosa cell viability , oocyte developmental competence and subsequent embryo quality possibly explaining differences in oocyte quality in obese patients described by others ."
